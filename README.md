# vfsa_1d

This package demonstrate who one can parametrize a VFSA optimization algorithm for a 1D objective functions.

Simply run this code "vfsa_1d_v01.m" and it will find all the dependencies.

Contribution are welcome to include other objective fucntions. Converting the codes to other programming languages are also welcome.

The current objective function is a 1D finction with a global minimum at (0,0).
